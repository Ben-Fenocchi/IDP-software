This integrated design project is a robotics team competition run by the Cambridge University Engineering Department.
This years task is to build a robot capable of locating blocks scatered randomly on a table. Distinguish them by their density/porosity, and return them to their respective areas.
The robot must conform to design specifications, and use only pre-approved components.

The exercise fosters inter-disciplinary communication, team-work and engineering skills.
